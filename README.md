# Backend Tasks

Two tasks were undertaken in this project:
- Database optimization: Documentation for the proposed database optimization strategy can be found here: [OPTIMIZATION.md](https://github.com/Taiwopeter-babs/techprosng-backend-task/blob/c37e0ae9b1c37af9024173ad896aadc673831254/OPTIMIZATION.md)
- RESTful API Development: The documentation of the API is detailed below.

## RESTful API
API endpoints were designed for three use cases:
- User authentication
- Course enrollment
- User information retrieval
Express, a JavaScript web framework, was used with the Node.js (v20.8.1) runtime environment to develop and test the endpoints. The data used/generated is not persisted in any database or json file as it is arbitrary, and is used for quick prototyping. See [here]()
